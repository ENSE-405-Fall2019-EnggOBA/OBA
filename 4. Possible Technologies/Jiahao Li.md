# Possible Technologies
Based on what I know and what I am interested about the frontend and backend languages and framework tools, here I list all possible terms.
And expressing my preference on what can I do as the development team.

## Frontend

 - Languages
	 - HTML/CSS/JavaScript 
	 - Maybe Node.js that I have not experienced yet
 - Frameworks/tools
	 - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), is a progressive framework that can easy to get play around and integrate with supporting libraries when buliding a user interface
	 - [React](https://reactjs.org/), is a JavaScript library for buliding user interface.Constructing code in the broswer(Chrome, Firefox, Safari...) or in the local development envrionment

## Backend

 - Languages
	 - Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python
	
 - Frameworks/tools
	 - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), that I have more experienced with
		 - based on Python, can be done on either frontend or backend
		 - clean, rapid development
		 - provide web application security by adding inline code - Cross Site Request Forgery Protection(CSRF)
	
	 - [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/cn/products/workbench/)
		 - great visual tool for designing, managing databases
		 - easy to connect various databases
	
	 - The LAMP
	 
		 - developing on Linux OS
		 - can use the AWS to develop and host the website

 

## Content Management System(CMS)

 - [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), as Tim mentioned
 - [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), has tons of plugins, templates, support community that can help on content management

## Testing Tools
> I am not familiar with testing tools so I just searched and added some possible popular methods/tools.
 - Data Factory
	 - Java API to generates random database data
	 
 - Data Generator
 
	 - testing on a large data that is used to store in database before the database is reaching out the limit(Boundary testing)
	 
 - JUnit testing
 
	 - testing a small unit of code its percentage of coverage
	 
 - Jmeter
 
	 - Web application performance testing on static and dynamic resources
	 - that can ensure it works well if there are amount numbers of pros or OBA committees are online simultaneously

## Responsibility as A Dev Team Member

 - I can do either frontend or backend stuff, depending on the balancing distribution work that determined by group discussion later
